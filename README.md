Plugin made specifically for a client (open source)

*Dependencies: LuckPerms*


This plugin allows a minecraft user on the server to link their account with their discord account.

Once you have linked your account, you are given the role that matches with your assigned group in LuckPerms.

Every time your group changes, your discord role is automatically changed.
